This week has given me a while to think about how amazing this season has been. I couldn’t be more proud of this team, and what we have been able to accomplish this year. Seattle is home to the greatest fans in the NFL, and we are excited to be in a position to potentially bring home the trophy that this city deserves!

This last two weeks has been filled with media interviews, recovery, practice, film and game plan installs. When you reach this point of the season, recovery becomes that much more important. All of us have been battling through injuries, and typical wear and tear this year. We have all been taking advantage of this extra week, to recover, and make sure our bodies are good to go for next Sunday.

Obviously, we still have a few things to clean up from the NFL Championship game. Offensively, last week has been spent tweaking a few things up front, and installing offensive game plans, to go over in New Jersey during this final week of preparation. We received some great news last week, that Percy has been cleared for the game! Having this guy healthy, adds a whole new element to our offense.

I couldn’t be more proud of the fight in our offense this year. The clutch play out of guys like Marshawn, Russell, Baldwin, Kearse, and Tate have been amazing to watch. No matter what the situation is, someone comes through and gets it done for us. That is what this entire team’s mind set is all about.

We have that, “next man up” mentality that leads to us knowing that someone is always going to come through in clutch situations and produce for this team! Our last game played was a big one for our defense. Kam, Bobby and the entire defense played unbelievable. We were able to create pressure in the back-field, flow to the ball, and blanket receivers up top. This is the type of play we need to bring to the table, against Manning and his high powered offense. Peyton is an amazing field general that is constantly changing plays on the spot, and mixing up offensive schemes. It is important that we create as much back-field pressure as possible, and bring new defensive looks that Manning has not seen before.

I know the “Fight in the Big Lights” is a few days away, but I am ready for this game! The Super Bowl, is a once in a lifetime opportunity, that you dream about playing in as a kid. To be competing in one of the greatest sporting events in the world, is truly a blessing, and I wouldn’t rather be playing in it with any other group of guys. This team, and our coaches mean so much to me. We have something very special here in Seattle, and we are looking to finish this season on the right note. I hope to see a lot of you 12’s in New York/ New Jersey. You all better dress warm, and bring the noise!
