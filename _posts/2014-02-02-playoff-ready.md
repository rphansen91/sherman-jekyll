Winning the NFC West was a great achievement, but we’re not done yet! I couldn’t be more proud of my boys, and you 12s, for the amazing year we have had thus far. Seattle is truly a special place with remarkable fans who make this game fun to play! It has been a long road traveled and we have left ourselves in a position to do something amazing.

This week gives our team the opportunity to let our bodies heal and improve weaknesses in our technique. We’ve had two very productive practices with Thursday being one of the most productive practices we have had all year! This was in large part due to the first-team offense going up against the first-team defense which always brings a higher level of intensity to the table. The thing I love the most about this team is that every player is so competitive. We never ease up on each other whether it be trash talking or hard hitting on the field.

Thursday’s practice brought another exciting element in the return of Percy Harvin. It was great to see him return to the field and be a part of practice again. Percy is an amazing football player who brings game changing speed and big play capabilities to the table. He has had his ups and downs this year and I am proud of the way he has handled it all. Adding Percy into the mix next week will add a powerful dynamic to our offense. We are excited to see how he progresses over the next week, and hope he can join us on the field next Saturday!

On the defensive side of the ball, we are catching our stride at the right time of the season. The combination of selfless playing and trusting each other is what makes this defense so special. There are many things that our defensive unit has learned about one another throughout the season. Our successful style of play this year has been a result of everyone learning one another’s tendencies and playing with those in mind.

This weekend’s matchups will be exciting to watch. We know that San Francisco, New Orleans, and Green Bay are the 3 potential opponents we may face next Saturday. This weekend provides us with the opportunity to watch each of these teams and break down their tendencies. Regardless of who we face, we need to be fundamentally sound going into the game. We are doing everything we can to stay football minded this week, and look forward to preparing for our first Playoff opponent.

I hope all of you 12s had a happy New Year and enjoy the games this weekend. We can’t thank you enough for your tremendous support week in and week out. You are the reason CenturyLink has the reputation as one of the toughest football environments to play in and we are truly appreciative of you! We are 2 opponents away from reaching the stage that every team has set out to reach this year. We are looking forward to finishing the rest of this journey, and working hard to come out on top!
